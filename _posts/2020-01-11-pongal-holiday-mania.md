Starting learning about async await of dart from [here](https://dart.dev/codelabs/async-await) to create the parser for my [compiler](https://github.com/thisHermit/java-bros).

I will add issues to the repo so that it is more organised.

Planning to add a automated script on runtime to commit last night's work on blog. A startup script would do wonders. Signing the commits would be required too.
